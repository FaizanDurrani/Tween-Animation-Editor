# Tween Animation Editor
## What?
The idea is to make a "Template" based tweening system using [xNode](https://github.com/siccity/xnode) for the node editor. The "Templates" will be saved as xNode graphs which can be configured from a custom editor.

## Why?
To let artists make GUI Animations without importing the whole project

## When?
Not sure yet. I am working on this in my free time and I don't really have that much free time.

The code *probably* isn't clean, feel free to rant about it in Issues if you think something can be cleaned up or just submit a pull request :). 

### Note: I'll be pushing directly to master until this becomes usable
